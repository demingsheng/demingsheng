I am an incoming PhD student at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) in Saudi Arabia, supervised by [Prof. Ricardo Henao](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/ricardo-henao). I am currently working on [Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence](https://bioe.kaust.edu.sa/team/bioinformatics-machine-learning).

Previously, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, [Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)](http://whut.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jingling Yuan](http://cst.whut.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/201505/t20150527_876882.shtml).

My research interests include but not limited to Natural Language Processing, Educational Data Mining, Survival Analysis, and Recommender Systems. I have published [11](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zz_wAIYAAAAJ) papers ([5](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zz_wAIYAAAAJ) as the first author) at the both international and Chinese AI conferences and journals, for example, [FGCS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/future-generation-computer-systems) (JCR Q1, IF=7.307).
