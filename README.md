I am a PhD student at [Duke University]([https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en](https://duke.edu/)) in the United States, supervised by [Prof. Ricardo Henao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=p_mm4-YAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I am currently working on [Biostatistics](https://biostat.duke.edu/education-and-training/phd-biostatistics).

Previously, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, [Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)](http://whut.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jingling Yuan](http://cst.whut.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/201505/t20150527_876882.shtml). I was selected as one of the [Top 10 Outstanding WUT Graduate Representatives](https://weibo.com/1899783701/4783567697353785) (10/13678), and my Master's thesis was rated as an [Outstanding Master's Degree Thesis of WUT](http://gd.whut.edu.cn/xw/tzgg/202301/P020230103591544236978.pdf) (Top 2%).

My research interests include but are not limited to Biostatistics, Artificial Intelligence and Survival Analysis. I have published [11](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zz_wAIYAAAAJ) papers ([5](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zz_wAIYAAAAJ) as the first author) at both international and Chinese AI conferences and journals, for example, [FGCS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/future-generation-computer-systems) (JCR Q1, IF=7.307).
